have the extender work with the generatepipe because now it just works with preview

fix preview rotation on extender

WRITE DOCUMENT
CODE CLEANUP
ONE BUG RELATED TO THE VERTICES ROTATION WHEN GOING STRAIGHT IN THE X DIRECTION(gimbal lock) FIXED!!!!!!



GENERAL EXTRA:

would be applying the curve in y direction aswell
updating the pipe check for it to work with the updated features
and having the pipe bend slightly in situations where it would be able to curve around an object

EXTRA FOR ART POINTS:

add texture rotation
double the vertices to get flat shading by making every triangle with unique vertices
add flowmap shader to simulate liquid inside pipe

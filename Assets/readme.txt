generated points between the 2 points and lowering or upping them until they are positioned
in a spot where their raycasts hit a specific threshold
this will also count as the check to see if a line between these points can even be created

give the vertices the correct direction
^do this by turning the vector3 points to transforms so you can save direction to them aswell
fix the triangles errors
